        paragraphOne: 'Whenever we intake any type of food, sometimes the first thing that comes in mind of a health conscious person is the amount of calories it contains or is it actually not good for their health? But what does calories exactly mean? Is it only a scientific term? If we look at it’s definition , one may think of it as a complex term which typically means a unit of energy defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a quantity of water by one degree celsius. Sounds way too scientific or difficult to grasp? In simple terms, calories in food is the energy we provide to our bodies such that it can function properly. More surprisingly, Different types of food provide different levels of energy. The three main macronutrients, carbohydrates , proteins and fats respectively are not equal in the number of calories they provide.',
        paragraphTwo: 'Calories are often associated with a person’s weight. It has been believed that if you intake food with calories in excess of 3500, you gain one pound. And if you want to lose weight , you need to reduce the calorie intake by creating a calorie deficit. Even many experts say that one needs to burn calories in order to reduce weight , and we cannot really challenge them about this.However , if you intake more calories than your body requirements , you will definitely gain weight and these excess calories will be stored as body fat. Even though our body requires some stored fat to stay healthy , but if it stores too much , you may even have serious health issues. Some foods provide very little nutrition to our body and these are what we refer as empty calories. Baked desserts, soda fall under such categories. Calories are quite vital to remain healthy and functional for any human being. The key remains consuming the right amount depending upon a person’s sex, size , activity level and age.',
        paragraphThree: 'It seems quite obvious that calorie intake would depend on a person’s age, body size, gender and some other factors as well. Keeping track of your calorie intake helps you better understand the number of calories your body needs to lose, gain, or sustain a certain weight. Whatever your goal, whether it is to increase or decrease weight, knowing the amount of calories your body takes certainly guides you towards your motive',
        paragraphFour:'Generally, men tend to have larger frames and more muscle mass than women. Therefore , quite obviously their calorie intake needs are higher. However, overindulging in calories will lead to obesity and other health diseases. Although calorie requirements are highly individualized, according to dietary guidelines, calorie estimates for men and women based on age and activity level. For example, general intake for adult women ranges 1,600 to 2,400 calories daily, while men often require 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day to maintain healthy body weights. The more active a person is, the more calories their body requires. As far as general trends are concerned, calorie requirements of a person decrease after the age of 35 and further decrease after the age of 50 due to a reduce in activities performed by the person and also in metabolic activities.',
        paragraphFive:'Estimated amounts of calorie requirements based on a person’s age and gender differ accordingly depending on their activity status and other factors as said. For example, a normal and active child needs close to 1000 calories a day. Similarly, an active young adult female requires around 1600 to 2400 calories a day. After the age of 50, these calorie requirements reduce to 1800 calories a day which is not rather significant. As said earlier, for an average young adult male, the calorie requirements vary from 2500 to 3000 calories per day. As metabolic activities happening in body reduce after the age of 50, the calorie needs reduce as well to 2200-2400 a day.',
        paragraphSix: 'Again, calories required to lose weight depends on person to person and their overall lifestyle. Despite practicing various diet routines and strategies, it boils down to the fact that how many calories you are burning in a day. There are many weight loss methods available for cutting down on calories but you need to realise what works best for your body. The ideology is simple, if you burn more calories than you intake, you’re bound to lose weight. In general, if an active human being without any medical problems cuts down 500-1000 calories a week, he’ll lose close to 0.5 Kgs a week!',
